# Car tracting

## Goal
Goal of this excercise is to verify knowledge of procedural programming and knowledge of C++.

## Assigment

Write a console application in C++ that will work as a function that processes list of car GPS coordinates and computes properties of such drive.

As and input youse positions in car_positions.csv or car_positions.json file. File contains positions of a car recorded in 20seconds intervals.

Your program should do following:

1. load data from a file to a suitable format (hardcode data if you dont know how to read from file).
2. filter out invalid data (0,0 positions)
3. compute and print number of valid records
4. compute and print total distance
4. compute and print average speed of car
